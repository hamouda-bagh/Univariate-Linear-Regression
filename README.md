# Univariate-Linear-Regression
A coursera guided project

In this repository, you will find the jupyter notebook file which contains the code I wrote when learning Univariate Linear Regression on a coursera guided project.
What the algorithm do is performing the cost function, gradient descent, and data visualizations and plots using matplotlib.
